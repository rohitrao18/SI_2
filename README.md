🔐 Just Launched: A Simple Encryption & Decryption Tool! 🔐

I’m excited to share a recent project I completed to explore the world of encryption and data confidentiality. This tool is a lightweight yet effective solution designed for educational purposes or as an introductory step into encryption concepts. Here’s what it does:

✨ Converts Plaintext to Ciphertext & Vice Versa
The tool uses the Vigenère cipher to encrypt sensitive information, adding a layer of protection with a repeating keyword. With both encryption and decryption capabilities, it’s easy to secure and retrieve your data.

💻 Interactive GUI for Easy Use
To make it user-friendly, I built a simple graphical interface where you can input your text, enter a keyword, and instantly get your encrypted or decrypted results.

🎯 Why This Matters
In today’s digital age, understanding data confidentiality and encryption basics is crucial. This project gave me practical insights into secure data handling and basic cryptography techniques, reinforcing the importance of protecting sensitive information.
